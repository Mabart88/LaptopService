# LaptopService

Project created during CodersLab Java Web Developer course. It's Java Maven project with Spring, Spring JPA, Hibernate. It was connected to MySQL database. Frontend part is JSP (HTML + Bootstrap).

This project is very old and I would do nearly everything different right now (16.01.2019).
